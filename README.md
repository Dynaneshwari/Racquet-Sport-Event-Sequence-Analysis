# Racquet-Sport-Event-Sequence-Analysis

1 Introduction
Mainly focusing on visual tactics of racquet sports. Among the numerous tactical patterns in tennis, player can prefer which ones can help them score more
points.
In the unified data format for tennis matches, each match consists of a series of sequences, where each sequence represents a rally within the match. A rally is a continuous exchange of shots between players until a point is won or lost. Each sequence, denoted as S, is comprised of an ordered list of events, e1, e2,e3,....en, where n is the number of events in the rally.

Algorithms which where used in the paper:
MDL algorithms provide a principled approach to model selection and complexity regularization by balancing the trade-off between model complexity and data fit. They are widely used in various domains, including machine learning, statistics, and information theory, to derive models that are both accurate and parsimonious.
MDS is a flexible and powerful technique for visualizing high-dimensional data and uncovering underlying patterns or relationships between objects. It can be applied to various types of data, including similarity matrices derived from text, image, or biological data, to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.

2 Further improvisation
Currently, reading more research papers to find new datasets and implement
algorithms. Refering to RASIPAM: Interactive Pattern Mining of Multivariate
Event Sequences in Racket Sports.
